Repository for A02
# This is a Repository for A02 asignment.
I don't like using webstorm as it makes you sign up for stuff, but if your looking for a IDE I'd recomend searching up one for HTML. Or, I recomend using VS Code. To use VS Code or VSC you first have to download a installer for your browser. Each browser has a different installer so make sure to pick the right one. After you download the installer, you can run it to install VSC and then go through the process of setting it up. Here is a LINK: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
1. **Branch** In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository
2. **Clone** A clone is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files.
3. **Commit** Commit is a command that acts as a save point in a project, which uploads it to the cloud.
4. **Fetch** Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people.
5. **GIT** Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management.
6. **Github** GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. 
7. **Merge** You can merge different branches into a single one or even other code you fetched.
8. **Merge Conflict** Merge conflict is when a problem occurs when you merge
9. **Push** The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
10. **Pull** The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
11. **Remote** A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.
12. **Repository** It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history.
